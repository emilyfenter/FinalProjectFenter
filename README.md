# FinalProjectFenter

## This is my website for the final project of 25SU Web Development.

This website is about the horses I love at Knoll farm where I ride most weekends. 
You will find the index.html file has my code to insert the information, link pictures and video, and general formatting of header, body, footer.
You will find the style.css file has my code to create the grid correctly, three columns for each section, interactive menu, and my color/font choices.  The other files and the images and video I used on the website.
